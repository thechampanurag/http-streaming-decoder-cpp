HTTP protocol decoder

* parse any HTTP data streaming
* non-blocking process
* compatible with non-blocking or blocking socket architecture
* http decoding monitoring

<hr/>

<b>Generality</b>

This repo features source code and test project for http decoder library.

Library is generated as a shared library (.dll or .so)

This project uses QtCore and is build with qmake utility (you can use QtCreator to build it)

<hr/>

<b>Program syntax for decoding HTTP frames</b>

First you have to declare the ``httpdecoder`` object

``httpdecoder decoder;``

Then instantiate a new ``httpconsumer`` : this object will monitor your data streaming decoding and will contain decoded frame(s)

``httpconsumer *consumer = new httpconsumer;``

For both of them you'll need these import : <br/>
``#include "protocol/http/httpdecoder.h"``<br/>
``#include "protocol/inter/http/httpconsumer.h"``<br/>


Your data streaming will be put to a ``QByteArray *`` to be sent to http decoder :<br/>
``QByteArray *httpframe = new QByteArray("POST /rest/help/todo HTTP/1.1\r\nheaders1:  value1\r\nheaders2:  value2\r\nContent-Length:  15\r\n\r\nbodyTobeWritten\r\n")``

Eventually decode with : 

``decoder.httpdecode(consumer,httpFrame);``

* Result of decoding will be in your pointer to consumer object you have just created

* You can access to decoded frame with ``consumer->getHttpFrameList()`` which is a ``vector<httpconsumer*>`` you can iterate

* Then you can remove frame you have treated and re-loop to decode again with the same object if you want to

* You must delete your consumer when you are done with it (socket destroyed / destructor ...)

Complete exemple in ./http-decoder-test/launcher.cpp

<b>Exemple</b>

``httpdecoder decoder;``

``httpconsumer *consumer = new httpconsumer;``

``QByteArray *httpframe = "POST /rest/help/todo HTTP/1.1\r\nheaders1:  value1\r\nheaders2:  value2\r\nContent-Length:  15\r\n\r\nbodyTobeWritten\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\n";``

``httpframe = new QByteArray(data1);``

``decoder.httpdecode(consumer,httpframe);``

From consumer object ``consumer->getHttpFrameList()`` you can extract those fields : 

  method name      |  data         | type                              | exemple
| ---------------  | ------------- | --------------------------------  | ----------------------
| getUri()         | uri           | std::string                       | /api/rest              |
| getMethod()      | method        | std::string                       | POST                   |
| getBody()        | body          | std::string                       | {"data":"OK"}          |
| getQueryString() | querystring   | std::string                       | Not Found              |
| getStatusCode()  | status code   | int                               | 404                    |
| getHeaders()     | headers       | std::map<std::string,std::string> |("Content-Length","15") |

<b>How to build</b>

This is composed of 2 projects:
* http decoder library project
* http decoder test 

You can open .pro file of both with qtcreator and build project

<hr/>

* Project is Qt4 compliant
* You can build it with qmake
* Development on QtCreator
* Specification from https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt
